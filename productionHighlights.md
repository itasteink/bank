Rough vocal draft, cool track that gets less cool at the end.
Lots of potential until the last section, I think.

This is totally a rough draft of a fucking hit pop track.
But I never finish shit, so this is as far as it will ever go prolly.
I thought the drop thing was cool, but then it killed my vision for where it was going.

## Old projects.

I had been producing for literally like 2 or 3 weeks when I created this.
It is the first track that I tried to mix vocals on. (My brother singing/rapping.)
I showed up to his house and we had been making a lot of music, but no vocals,
which he was borwed with because he is a vocalist and just watching me write music
he never get's to record on top of was getting bored for him. So I told him 3
hours on music, 3 hours on vocals. At the end of the 6 hours, whatever we have
is final. (Like a time challenge.) You may notice... we forgot any bass whatsoever lol.

I've always thought this was fucking cool, but idk where to go with it. And,
story: Alright, so in February I was tripping on a bunch of acid with my girlfriend
(who was sober) and I was playing back through my Bandlab and found this demo
and lost my fucking mind. Thought it was the best thing since Marshall Mathers.
(I've created a monster. Nobody wanna see Marshall no more, they want Taste Ink. He's
chopped liver.) And so like, I thought I was gonna be fucking famous off this like
1 minute popÂ build up and I was gonna be hanging with Billie Eilish and Stevie Nicks
and shit. So, thinking I was gonna be rich, I started destroying all my fucking studio
equipment and my computer and desk and shit, hahaha. Luckily she stopped me before
I did doo much damage, but I just had this vision in my head that people would hear
this and say "whos that noise?!" And so "whos that noise" has been kinda my catchphrase
when I hear a banger I've never heard before, haha.

I created this with like 1.5 months of production under my belt. It is the second song my brother and I did together. It divided us because I am on this whole
"out here tryina make people's day better" shit (not like a social justice warrior, but
I try to do some good every day and if I know something can/will affect somebody negatively
I just don't fucking do it because it is that easy to give shit that people feel different
ways about different things and maybe, just maybeeee, if you give a shit for somebody, maybe
somebody will give a shit back one day. idk im still waiting haha) and he tried to drop
"Midg*t" in this song and I was like.. I think they have said they find that term offensive
so we could literally choose a billion other wordplay things we could do there.." and he
wanted to drunken fist fight me one night about it, haha. I stood my ground, he came around
and quit objecting to how I censored the song.

The first song I got excited to produce with my brother. I don't always *love*
the songs I make with him because he wants me to just record him freesttyling
and make it work... but like, that is not how *good* songs come together lol.

I am trying to produce something and he is usually just wanting to perform his wordplay and ability to go ~fast over difficult
phrases. But he kinda sat down and wrote this stuff, and it sounded great. Who the fuck knows
what the song is about, though, haha. He says it is about getting into the creative mindset,
but hook 2 he's talking about shooting people in the head and the bridge I'm on about some
"I am the best", "I can't dis for shit", and "killin myself" shit haha.
This song is a banger, for fucking real, though. (I think...)

Basically my first attempt at any sort of EDM-inspired stuff. I bought a new
electronic/acoustic guitar that day and wanted to test it out and for some reason
it came out EDM, haha. It is actually pretty cool, but died young because I didn't
know where to go with it. It has this off-beat reggae chord playing in the last
half of the drop that is pretty cool.

This is such a chill experience. I love it, although its so simple. I struggle with keeping things simple because I usually don't do vocals, so I have a habit of trying to make my music complex and entertaining to make up for it.

My brother freestyling and I kinda chopped it up and tried to salvage it.

Man, this is a fucking cool track. Some exotic sounding wind instruments, completely unpredictable transitions, and, I gotta brag on myself, for only having been producing for like 11 months at this point, I am so fucking proud of the bass. The clean 808s are just bad ass, the dirty bass is kick ass, and the "growing" bass sound in the hook... they're all just masterful I think.

EDM-ish, but... not like anything else? Cool ass tempo change on the drop.
